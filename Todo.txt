Target Areas for Data Cleaning
Outlier Detection and Treatment: Identify and handle outliers in numerical columns.(completely remove or change to mean)

Data Type Conversion: Ensure that columns have the correct data types (e.g., converting strings to dates).
Normalization/Standardization: Normalize or standardize numerical features for better performance in machine learning models.
Encoding Categorical Variables: Convert categorical variables into numerical format using techniques like one-hot encoding or label encoding.
Removing Duplicates: Identify and remove duplicate rows in the dataset.
Feature Scaling: Scale numerical features to a specific range (e.g., Min-Max scaling).
Text Cleaning: Clean text data by removing special characters, converting to lowercase, etc.
Date Handling: Convert date strings to datetime objects and extract useful features (e.g., year, month).
Feature Engineering: Create new features based on existing ones (e.g., extracting the day of the week from a date).
